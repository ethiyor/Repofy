  - Real-time search across repository names, descriptions, and tags
  - Filter by visibility (public/private), star count, date ranges
  - Tag-based filtering with visual tag buttons
  - Sort by date, name, or popularity
- **Improved Repository Cards**: 
  - Expandable/collapsible views
  - Grid and list view modes
  - Better visual hierarchy and information density
  - Repository statistics (stars, files, comments)

### 3. **Analytics Dashboard** 📊
*Leveraging your data analysis background from astrophysics research*
- **Repository Analytics**:
  - Total repositories and stars overview
  - Most popular repository identification
  - Recent activity tracking (30-day window)
  - Technology/language usage statistics
  - Monthly growth charts (6-month trend)
- **Visual Data Representation**:
  - Color-coded language statistics
  - Interactive growth charts
  - Activity timeline with visual indicators

### 4. **Notification System** 🔔
- **Smart Notifications**: Replace basic alert() with professional toast notifications
- **Contextual Feedback**: Success, error, warning, and info notifications
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable timeout with manual dismiss options
- **Non-blocking**: Notifications don't interrupt user workflow

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling** 🛡️
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Better error recovery and user feedback
- **Network Resilience**: Proper handling of API failures
- **User-friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Loading States**: Prevents user confusion during async operations

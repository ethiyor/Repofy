# Profile Picture Upload Feature

## Overview
Added a profile picture upload feature that allows users to upload and display custom profile pictures instead of just showing their initials.

## Changes Made

### Backend (server/index.js)
1. **Updated Profile Endpoint**: Modified `/profile` POST endpoint to handle `avatar_url` field
2. **Added Avatar Upload Endpoint**: New `/profile/avatar` POST endpoint for uploading profile pictures
   - Accepts base64 encoded image data
   - Validates image format (must start with 'data:image/')
   - Stores the base64 data directly in the database

### Frontend Changes

#### UserProfile.js
1. **Upload Functionality**: Added `handleAvatarUpload` function
   - File validation (image type, max 2MB size)
   - Converts image to base64 format
   - Uploads to server via API call

2. **Remove Functionality**: Added `handleRemoveAvatar` function
   - Allows users to remove their profile picture
   - Resets avatar_url to null

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Clickable avatar with camera hint icon
   - Upload progress indicator
   - Remove button (×) that appears when avatar exists
   - Hidden file input for image selection

#### Navbar.js
- Updated to display profile picture when available
- Falls back to initials when no avatar is set

#### PublicProfile.js
- Updated to show profile pictures in public profiles
- Maintains initials fallback

#### RepoList.js
- Updated user avatars in repository listings
- Shows profile pictures when available

### Database
- Utilizes existing `avatar_url` field in `user_profiles` table
- Stores base64 encoded image data

### CSS Styles (App.css)
1. **Clickable Avatar Styles**: 
   - Hover effects with scaling and border
   - Transition animations

2. **Camera Hint**: Small camera icon overlay for upload indication

3. **Upload Overlay**: Loading indicator during upload

4. **Remove Button**: Styled remove button (×) positioned on avatar

5. **Avatar Container**: Wrapper for positioning remove button

## User Experience

### Upload Process
1. User clicks on their profile avatar (shows camera hint if no picture)
2. File picker opens for image selection
3. Image is validated and uploaded
4. Profile updates immediately with new picture
5. Remove button (×) appears for deletion option

### Display Logic
- Profile pictures are shown in:
  - Navbar profile icon (current user)
  - User profile page (large avatar)
  - Public profile views (other users can see your picture)
  - Repository listings (user sections - visible to all users)
- Falls back to initials when no avatar is set
- **Cross-user visibility**: Other users can see your profile picture in:
  - Public profile pages
  - Repository user listings
  - Any shared content areas

### File Limitations
- Maximum original file size: 5MB (before compression)
- Maximum compressed file size: 10MB (server limit)
- Images are automatically compressed to 300x300px max
- Compression quality: 70% (JPEG format)
- Supported input formats: All image types (image/*)
- Storage: Base64 encoded in database

## Recent Fixes
- **Fixed 413 Error**: Increased server request size limit to 10MB
- **Added Image Compression**: Automatically compresses images to reduce payload size
- **Better Error Handling**: More specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- **Size Validation**: Both client and server-side validation
- **Cross-user Visibility**: Fixed backend endpoints to include `avatar_url` in:
  - Public profile endpoint (`/profile/:userId`)
  - Repository listings endpoint (`/repos`)
  - User profile endpoint (`/profile`)
- **Fallback Support**: Proper fallback to initials when no avatar is uploaded

## Security Features
- File type validation
- File size limits
- User authentication required for upload/remove
- Users can only modify their own avatars

## Technical Notes
- Uses base64 encoding to avoid external file storage
- No additional dependencies required
- Backward compatible (existing users without avatars work normally)
- Responsive design maintained across all components
